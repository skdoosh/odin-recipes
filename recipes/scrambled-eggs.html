<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Fluffy microwave scrambled eggs offer a quick and convenient way to enjoy a delicious breakfast or snack without needing to use a stovetop. To make them, simply whisk together eggs, a splash of milk, and a pinch of salt and pepper in a microwave-safe bowl. The mixture is then cooked in short intervals, usually around 30 seconds at a time, stirring between each interval to ensure even cooking and to achieve a light, airy texture. The result is a soft and fluffy scramble that's ready in just a few minutes.</p>
<p>This method of cooking scrambled eggs is not only time-efficient but also minimizes cleanup, as the eggs are prepared in the same bowl used for mixing. For added flavor and variety, you can mix in cheese, herbs, or cooked vegetables before microwaving. The microwave’s gentle heat helps to retain the eggs' moisture, preventing them from becoming dry or rubbery, which can sometimes happen with traditional cooking methods. Whether you're in a hurry or just prefer an easy meal, fluffy microwave scrambled eggs provide a tasty and satisfying option.</p>
