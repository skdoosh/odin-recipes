<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Make hard-boiled eggs with my method that makes the most perfect eggs ever â€” and they're easy to peel. The whites are firm but not rubbery, and the yolks are cooked and still creamy.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li> 6 medium sized eggs</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Place eggs in a saucepan and pour in cold water to cover; place over high heat.</li>
    <li>When water starts to simmer and eggs start to dance around a little, turn off heat, cover the pan quickly with a lid, and let stand for 17 minutes. Don't peek.</li>
    <li>Pour out hot water and pour cold water over the eggs. Drain and refill with cold water; let stand until eggs are cool, about 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Peel eggs under running water.</li>
</ol>
